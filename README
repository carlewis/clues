CLUES - Cluster Energy Saving System

0. DESCRIPTION

CLUES is a energy management system for HPC clusters and Cloud infrastructures
whose main function is to power off the working nodes of computer clusters while
they are not being used, and power them on again when they are needed. It is
integrated with the management middleware of the cluster by using a set of
different "middleware connectors". Some examples of management middlewares are
queue batch system or cloud computing infrastructure manager.

1. INSTALLATION

If you are following this guide, you are advised to read the whole guide prior to
start installing CLUES. In fact, this guide is very straightforward. For more
detailed information read the CLUES Installation Guide.

1.1 REQUISITES

CLUES is based on python, so Python 2.4 or higher runtime and standard library
must be installed in the system.

If you want to make use of reports tools, you will need to install sqlite support
for python (either sqlite or sqlite3).

CLUES is written in python, so Python 2.4 or higher runtime and standard library
must be installed in the system.

Sqlite support for python (either sqlite or sqlite3) is an optional but recommended
package. Some of the functionalities of CLUES will be disabled if it is not
present in the system.

It is also required to have a properly configured system to switch on/off the
nodes of the cluster. It can be Wake-on-Lan, Intelligent Platform Management
Interface (IPMI) or some particular implementation. 

1.2 OPTIONAL PACKAGES

To enable clues_report command to perform the host_graph operation to generate a
graph showing the evolution of the node states over the time, it is needed to
install the rrdtool library.

1.3 INSTALLING

Select a proper path where to install the CLUES system (i.e. /usr/local/clues, 
/opt/clues or other). This path will be called CLUES_PATH

$ tar xvzf CLUES-X.XX.tar.gz
$ chown -R root:root CLUES-X.XX
$ mv CLUES-X.XX /usr/local

In case that you want the CLUES system to be started at boot time, you can execute 
the next set of commands

On Debian Systems:

$ chkconfig clues on

On RedHat Systems:

$ update-rc.d clues start 99 2 3 4 5 . stop 05 0 1 6 .

Or you can do it manually:

$ ln -s /usr/local/CLUES-X.XX/clues /etc/init.d
$ ln -s /etc/init.d/clues /etc/rc2.d/S99clues
$ ln -s /etc/init.d/clues /etc/rc3.d/S99clues
$ ln -s /etc/init.d/clues /etc/rc5.d/S99clues
$ ln -s /etc/init.d/clues /etc/rc1.d/K05clues
$ ln -s /etc/init.d/clues /etc/rc6.d/K05clues

1.4 CONFIGURATION

Adjust the installation path by setting the CLUES_PATH variable at $CLUES_PATH/clues 
to the path where the CLUES system is installed (e.g. /usr/local/clues).

Adjust the parameters in $CLUES_PATH/config.py. Please pay attention to the next 
configuration variables, as they are the most important

CLUES_PATH - must be set to the full path where the CLUES system is installed 
            (e.g. /usr/local/clues)
SERVER_PORT - must be set to a free TCP/IP port, where the XML-RPC server will be 
              listening-in
SERVER_HOST - DNS name or IP of the CLUES host. If it is set to localhost, CLUES
              daemon cannot be accessed outside the server host. If set to a public
              DNS or IP, it has security implications (see Security section).
MANAGERS=['plg_name'] - The plugin to use in the CLUES system. See the plugins
              installation section to get more information.

The other parameters may be adjusted acording to your specific installation.
For more information about configuration read the CLUES Installation Guide.

Download the plug-ins into the $CLUES_PATH/plugins directory and configure them to 
be used at the $CLUES_PATH/config.py file.

1.4.1 SECURITY

Security is disabled by default, but it should be taken into account that it would
be possible that someone that has network access to the clues server may power off
some of your nodes by using the XML-RPC remote API.

CLUES provides an authentication framework in order to avoid such situation. In case
that you want to enable the authentication framework, you must change the value of

  SECURITY_TOKEN_ENABLED

to True in the $CLUES_PATH/config.py file, and create the users by using the 
$CLUES_PATH/clues_user.py application.

To avoid typing the password, or if the CLUES commands are going to be used by
some kind of non-interactive service, you can create a file:
	$HOME/.clues/clues_auth
With this format:
	username:sha1(password)
